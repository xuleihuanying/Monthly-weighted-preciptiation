# Monthly-weighted-preciptiation


This dataste is generated based on the ongoing paper 'Improving global monthly precipitation estimation by fusing gauge observations, remote sensing and reanalysis datasets'.

A total of 13 kinds of precipitation datasets are involved, including 'GPCC', 'CRU TS', 'UDEL', 'CPC', 'PERSIANN-CDR', 'CMORPH', 'TRMM', 'GSMaP','CHIRPS', 'ERA-Interim', 'JRA55', 'MERRA-2' and 'WFDEI'.

The three-cornered hat (TCH) method is used to derive the relative uncertainty of individual datasets and the inverse of error variance is regarded as weights.

The climatology is unified by a simple average before TCH is applied.
